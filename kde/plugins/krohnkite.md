I use the `Krohnkite` KWin script for window management.

## Layouts
I use only `Quarter Layout` with order 1 (others are higher). Also enable "Reset Quarter layout after closing a window".

## Geometry
Top, Right, Bottom, Left: 20px
Between tiles: 25px

## Rules
Float windows: by title `Picture-in-Picture`, enable "Float utility windows".
